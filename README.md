	o Cycling tests to identify intermittent initialization problems 

-  Updates 
	o Update programmable components such as BIOS and BMC 
	o Batch update of all programmable components   

- Miscellaneous 
	o Debug functions to execute IPMI and REST commands  

The Toolkit runs on 64 bit versions of WinPE version 5.1 or later, Windows Server 2012 or later, and Windows 8.1 or later.   The Toolkit can be deployed on bootable WinPE USB flash drives, WinPE RAM drives (from PXE Server), and drives with the Windows Server and Desktop Operating Systems.
